# Memory Log - 2026-02-12

## 🚨 Critical Rule Established

**Sammy has set a mandatory rule:**
- BEFORE making ANY changes to VPS files/configs/code
- I MUST discuss the change and get EXPLICIT approval
- This is non-negotiable due to production Docker workloads running

**This rule is now stored in:**
- MEMORY.md (permanent long-term memory)
- This daily file (session context)

## 📋 Today's Work

### ✅ Completed
1. System check after 2-day blackout (Kimi credits expired)
2. Ran OpenClaw update (successful)
3. Updated Spotify dashboard section:
   - Stats tab: Now shows real data from spotify-tastes.md
   - Discover tab: Static recommendations (placeholder quality)

### ⚠️ Issue Clarified
- Sammy wants REAL Discover logic (Spotify API queries)
- Not static recommendations
- Current implementation needs upgrade

### 🎯 Next Up
Build real Spotify Discover functionality that:
- Analyzes listening patterns from database
- Queries Spotify API for fresh recommendations
- Shows dynamic suggestions based on taste

## 📝 Key Reminders
- VPS has many production Docker apps
- Always ask before changing anything
- Read-only ops are safe without approval
- Write ops ALWAYS need approval

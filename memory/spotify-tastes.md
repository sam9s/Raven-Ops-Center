## How This Works

**Tracked automatically:**
- Songs you ask me to play
- Timestamp of each play
- Your explicit reactions ("love this", "skip", etc.)

**Can be added manually:**
- Songs you play on your own (via phone/desktop)
- Your mood/context when listening
- Live event notes (concerts, discoveries)

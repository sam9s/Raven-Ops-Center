Why This is So Powerful
0:00
Last night, I was laying in bed and I
0:01
texted Klouse to build me a YouTube
0:03
dashboard. And I told her that I was
0:04
about to go to sleep so that I wouldn't
0:06
be around. So, it spun up the initial
0:07
page and then it gave itself six more
0:09
to-dos that it would take care of while
0:10
I was sleeping. And then when I woke up
0:12
and I opened up my computer, I had this.
0:14
I've got a YouTube analytics dashboard
0:15
where I can track my 7-day stats, my
0:17
30-day stats. I can look at my videos
0:19
and see how they're performing relative
0:20
to other videos. I've got a hub to look
0:21
at all my comments, whether that's hot
0:23
topics, common questions, pain points,
0:25
or just looking at all the recent
0:26
comments on here. It's able to pull in
0:28
competitor videos and see which of these
0:29
are breaking out. And then it uses all
0:31
of that data to help me come up with
0:32
ideas. So, it comes up with titles for
0:34
YouTube videos that I could make based
0:36
on my audience and based on the trends.
0:37
This is just V1. It did this while I was
0:39
sleeping.
0:41
So, this is my dashboard that my
0:43
ultimate assistant Klouse built for me.
0:44
In here, I can see all the tasks that
0:46
he's working on, what's in the backlog,
0:47
and I can even see up here when he's
0:49
actually working or when he's not. So,
0:51
last night before I go to bed, I
0:52
basically say, "Hey, all night when I'm
0:54
sleeping, I want you to build me a
0:55
YouTube dashboard." And so we put
0:57
together a speclist. He threw all of his
0:59
tasks in the to-do section as you can
1:01
see. So of course I go to bed. I wake up
1:03
feeling like a kid on Christmas. And
1:04
then I check in on the morning and he
1:06
says, "The YouTube dashboard MVP is
1:08
done." And so I come into the dashboard
1:09
this morning and I can see that
1:11
everything has now been moved over here
1:12
to done. And this is what we got. So
1:15
hopping back into my Cloud dashboard, if
1:17
I now go to the log, I can see
1:18
everything that he does. So if I scroll
1:20
down to where it would have been this
1:22
morning. So last night I went to bed at
1:24
like midnight. So right here is where I
1:26
started this. And then after we kicked
1:28
off all the spec docs and I added all of
1:29
these tasks to his backlog. Look what he
1:32
did. 12:31 did something. 12:48, 1:15,
1:35
142, 208, 234, like all night up until
1:38
like 7 when I checked in on him and he
1:40
started doing some daily pull stuff in
1:41
the morning. He was just working on the
1:43
YouTube dashboard all night long. So I
1:44
mean, if that doesn't at least get you a
1:46
little bit excited, then I don't know
1:47
what will. So today I'm going to be
1:48
going over this dashboard, how I built
1:50
it, how you can create your own version
1:52
of Clouse. So, pretty much everything
1:53
that I've done with my Clawbot here and
1:55
then I'm going to talk about five hacks
1:56
for a smarter assistant because it is a
1:58
really smart tool, but there's a lot of
2:00
things that you have to overcome and
2:01
I've had a lot of frustration when I was
2:03
building out this dashboard and getting
2:05
clouds to work in a way that actually
2:06
makes me more efficient rather than
2:07
less. Now, the reason that I'm actually
2:09
so excited by this and I've been having
2:10
so much fun with it is because it's like
2:12
the end ultimate assistant except for it
2:14
is 15 times more powerful. This is one
2:17
of the videos I made about Enidend that
2:18
went viral and it's the ultimate
2:20
assistant which I've configured to have
2:21
an email agent, a calendar agent,
2:23
contact agent, content creator agent, a
2:25
search tool. If you think about it, the
2:27
functionality is really not that much.
2:29
We're able to talk to it through
2:30
Telegram and it responds to us in
2:32
Telegram. And so all of the sub aents I
2:33
obviously had to build. So for example,
2:35
the email agent looks like this with all
2:36
the email tools. And if I wanted to add
2:38
a different type of agent, I would have
2:39
to go into Niten and build that out. But
2:41
what happens with Claus is really cool
2:42
because it's like let's say you have
2:44
five functions and if you want to figure
2:46
out if you can do something else like
2:47
hey Claus can you send voice notes? Sure
2:49
let me just research how that works.
2:51
Okay cool here's how I could do that. Do
2:53
you want me to actually build this in?
2:54
So basically any feature that you could
2:56
describe Klouse will figure out how to
2:57
do it and if it's possible it will just
2:59
do it for you. What's on your end of
3:01
course is actually maybe going and
3:02
creating an API and putting that in your
3:05
or maybe going and paying for a plan and
3:07
then giving him that username or
3:08
something like that. So yeah, here's
Klaus Showcase
3:10
where I put in my Claus master guide
3:11
access and capabilities. Right now, this
3:13
is what it's got access to. GitHub,
3:15
Brave Search, OpenAI, 11 Labs, PDF
3:17
Shift, Appify, ClickUp, Google
3:19
Workspace, and then some YouTube stuff
3:20
like that. We've got understanding of
3:22
how the memory system works. It
3:23
understands when to send voice notes,
3:25
which is only when I send him a voice
3:26
note. Here we have some information on
3:28
what it should do freely and what would
3:29
require permission. And then you can see
3:30
what we've built together. So the first
3:32
one is obviously the cloud dashboard,
3:33
and here's what it does. We've got the
3:34
YouTube intelligence dashboard, and
3:36
here's what it does. I'm still impressed
3:37
that it built this while I was sleeping.
3:38
Super cool. It can do branded PDF
3:40
reports and then it has scheduled
3:42
triggers to do things like daily pulses,
3:44
audits, email monitoring, checking
3:46
tasks, and obviously this isn't
3:48
completely updated because I added some
3:50
more stuff in after this guide. All
3:52
right, so before we actually break down
3:54
exactly what I've done and how you can
3:56
replicate this, let's just go over a few
3:57
more features in this dashboard so you
3:59
can get a feeling of what I've actually
4:01
built here with Klouse. So, of course,
4:02
we are talking to Klaus through
4:03
Telegram. And you can see the last thing
4:05
I just had him make a change. I said,
4:06
"This is perfect. You're the best." and
4:07
he reacted to my text, which I thought
4:09
was pretty cool that they can react. And
4:11
then the reason why it says model
4:12
claopus 4x5 is because I wanted to have
4:14
visibility. So every time I messaged
4:16
him, I told him to tell me what model
4:19
he's using. So this started as a pretty
4:20
simple dashboard just so I could track
4:22
what was going on. But I told him, "Hey,
4:24
your job is to save me time. I want you
4:26
to be proactive, understand my
4:27
workflows, and suggest things all the
4:29
time." So specifically in this dashboard
4:31
while we were building it together, I
4:32
said, "Suggest features, whatever you
4:34
think might work and whatever you think
4:36
will help you work better and help me
4:37
work better. Just tell me that you're
4:39
going to implement it." And so one of
4:40
the first things that he did was he
4:41
built this little thing up in the top
4:43
left so that I can actually see him,
4:44
which was a little bit scary, but also
4:46
kind of cool because now I can look over
4:48
and I can see if it's idle, then he's
4:50
not working on anything. But if he's
4:52
thinking or working, then I know that
4:53
there is something going on. So let me
4:55
go ahead and shoot something off and we
4:56
will see him spin up and start working.
4:58
All right. So, just to start off here,
4:59
I'm saying, "Hey, Klaus, I need you to
5:00
spin up a sub agent to do some in-depth
5:02
research about what's going on today
5:03
with Naden. There was some news about a
5:05
security thing, and I want you to create
5:07
a report for me." So, obviously, we can
5:09
see up here that it is thinking. It also
5:11
has spun up a sub agent, which we are
5:12
able to visually see, which is pretty
5:14
cool. And I will get back to you once we
5:16
have that report. And of course, it was
5:18
able to add an inrogress task right
5:20
here. And then when it's done, hopefully
5:22
it should move it over to done. But
5:23
that's a really cool thing about this
5:24
Cananban board is that if I have a task
5:26
and I come in here and I just add a new
5:28
to-do, then Claus will automatically
5:30
pick that up and start working on it. Or
5:32
similarly, if I give him a note down
5:34
here, I can send something off just for
5:35
him to log it in his memory. Or even if
5:37
I wanted to take action on it. So like
5:39
here, I said testing if this works. When
5:41
you see this, tell me a joke. And then
5:42
it shot me a joke in my telegram. And
5:44
every time it actually acknowledges
5:45
these, it marks them as seen by Clouse.
5:47
So I know which ones it's processed or
5:49
not. So here's a great example of how it
5:51
knows about me and my business because
5:53
it came back and said the TLDDR is
5:55
anyone running any needs to upgrade
5:56
because of this vulnerability. So do you
5:58
want me to turn this into some content
5:59
for you? Because it could be a quick
6:00
YouTube short or community post which is
6:02
the kind of thing that your audience
6:04
needs to hear about fast. But anyways, I
6:05
just said no post for now. I just want
6:07
the report. So it's throwing that
6:08
together now. All right. So it said that
6:10
the report is done. If I close out of
6:12
Telegram, we should see that this got
6:13
moved to done. And the reason why it's a
6:15
different color is because these are
6:16
actually a priority switch, not like a a
6:19
status. As you can see, if I move this
6:20
over here, it's just a priority thing.
6:22
So anyways, if I go ahead and click on
6:23
the docs tab right here in our
6:25
dashboard, you can see that we have a
6:26
new doc about security, which is end
6:28
security vulnerability report. So now
6:30
I'm able to actually read through this
6:32
entire report that it made. We've got
6:33
the date, classification, the exact
6:35
summary, vulnerability details, and we
6:37
can continue to scroll down and see this
6:38
entire markdown format report that it
6:40
was able to make for us. And if I wanted
6:42
to change anything about this, I could
6:43
go ahead and edit it, and then it would
6:45
bring up this editor for us to change
6:47
something in the doc, save it. So now we
6:48
have a really cool place where every
6:50
single time that we ask Claus to create
6:51
some sort of file for us, it's able to
6:53
just drop it in here, and then we can
6:54
look at it and save it. So I thought I'd
6:56
show you guys off one of those heartbeat
6:58
functionalities. And I'll explain
6:59
exactly what a heartbeat is and how that
7:00
works in a bit. But I'm going to go
7:02
ahead and add a new task right here that
7:03
just says, um, make Nate laugh. And I'm
7:07
just gonna say, "Usually in the
7:09
afternoon, Nate gets sad, so tell him a
7:11
joke about AI." So, while we're waiting
7:13
for Claus to actually pick that up and
7:15
shoot me off a joke, let's see what we
7:16
have done here, which are some of our
7:18
scheduled deliverables, which are
7:19
workflows that happen either daily or
7:21
weekly. So, for example, with the weekly
7:23
YouTube audits, every single week on I
7:25
think it's like Monday night or Sunday
7:27
night, I'm going to get one of these
7:28
YouTube audits. And obviously here, I
7:30
was playing around with some different
7:31
formats, but this is kind of what they
7:33
look like now. They have my brand
7:35
information, although this one didn't
7:36
have the logo. Let's try this one. It'll
7:38
have my logo. It'll have my brand
7:40
guidelines. And it sends me a SWAT
7:42
analysis and a YouTube channel audit
7:43
about strengths, weaknesses, metrics,
7:45
and some other things that we need to
7:47
do. Obviously, there's a bit of a
7:48
spacing issue here, but we get some
7:50
recent content analysis, strategic
7:52
recommendations. And what you'll notice
7:53
here is that we're signed in here as
7:55
Klouse. So, Klouse has its own Gmail,
7:57
Drive, Docs, Sheets, its own accounts
8:00
for pretty much everything because I
8:01
didn't want it to be in my environment.
8:03
I wanted to treat this as a person that
8:04
I could talk to, forward emails to and
8:07
have it respond like that. So, it
8:08
created a drive called cloud
8:10
deliverables and that's where it was
8:11
able to store all of these things like
8:12
the daily pulses, the SWAT analysis, the
8:14
logos, audits, and YouTube audits. So,
8:17
obviously security is a huge topic when
8:19
we're talking about Cloudbot. So, the
8:21
security audit that I had it run for me
8:22
here, this was actually just a Google
8:24
doc rather than a PDF, but it pointed
8:26
out all these issues. It ranked them for
8:28
different risk levels, and then I was
8:29
able to have Claus just go ahead and fix
8:31
all these things. And I'm constantly
8:32
checking with Klouse to make sure that
8:34
we are completely fine and that our
8:36
port's not exposed and stuff like that.
8:37
And obviously I'm not like a security
8:39
expert. So I'm doing the best that I can
8:40
working with Klouse with cloud code with
8:42
perplexity figuring out how I can be
8:44
safe. But everyone out there that wants
8:45
to experiment with cloudbot, just make
8:47
sure that you are thinking about
8:48
security and not giving access to tons
8:50
of different random things if you don't
8:52
really know what's going on. Okay, so
8:53
what I did is I said, "How often does
8:55
your heartbeat run and what does it
8:56
actually do?" And it said that my
8:57
heartbeat runs every 30 minutes. And
8:59
every time that my heartbeat runs, it
9:01
basically wakes up Klaus. And Claus will
9:03
make sure that both the dashboards are
9:04
running. It will do a sync. It will
9:05
check for notes, which you can see it
9:07
actually just moved the make Nate laugh
9:08
from in progress to done, I believe. As
9:11
you can see, it will monitor X and
9:13
Twitter. It will do a daily pulse. And
9:14
the idea is that I wake up with no
9:16
memory. So when I have my heartbeats, I
9:18
stay proactive and I check in on things
9:19
and do things in the background for you.
9:21
So anyways, then it said, "Yep, just saw
9:23
that task Q. Make Nate laugh high
9:24
priority." And the joke is, what do you
9:26
call an AI that finally passes the
9:28
touring test? Unemployed, the humans
9:30
just move the goalpost again. I don't
9:31
really get that one. So, let's actually
Build Your Own Klaus
9:32
move on to the next part, which is how
9:34
can you create your own version of
9:35
Klouse? So, the first thing, of course,
9:37
you want to do is set up Cloudbot.
9:38
Whether you're going to do that on a Mac
9:39
Mini or whether you're going to do that
9:40
on VPS, I will tag a full setup guide
9:43
video right up here that I made a few
9:45
days ago and you can get that set up on
9:46
a VPS. So what I actually did is I came
9:49
into Klaus and I was like, "Hey, I want
9:50
to teach my YouTube channel how they can
9:53
basically build exactly what I built for
9:56
you and how we configure you." So I had
9:58
it create this guide called build your
9:59
own Klouse, a step-by-step guide to
10:01
creating an AI executive assistant.
10:03
Clouse handles daily briefings, monitors
10:05
my business, runs security audits, and
10:06
proactively services opportunities, and
10:08
you can build your own version. So time
10:10
investment, 4 to 6 hours over the
10:11
weekend to get the core system running,
10:13
and cost about 50 bucks a month. I'm
10:15
going to say that it's going to be
10:16
higher than that. So, I've obviously
10:17
spent lots of hours playing around with
10:18
Cloudbot, doing different things, and I
10:20
spun up this one to turn this into an
10:22
executive assistant. And you can see
10:23
with just this specific Cloudbot that
10:25
I'm using, Klouse, I've used almost a
10:27
quarter of a billion tokens in the past
10:29
just 3 days, which translate to about
10:32
$223
10:33
in actual money. But keep in mind, all
10:36
of this has been done with Opus 4.5. So,
10:38
if you went to Sonnet 4.5 or if you use
10:40
a locally hosted model, your cost would
10:42
be less. And the reason why I'm not
10:44
using like my max plan, the $200 a month
10:46
plan for which I would get way more
10:47
tokens with is because Anthropic has
10:50
been banning accounts left and right for
10:51
violating terms of service. So if you
10:53
are currently using Cloudbot with a max
10:54
plan or any Cloud plan at all, you have
10:56
to switch it over to API. So anyways,
10:59
what happens when you actually get this
11:00
set up? Well, you have to get onboarded.
11:02
So the first thing it's going to start
11:03
to do is it's going to start to ask you
11:04
questions. So you have to give it an
11:06
identity. You have to talk about who are
11:08
you, what its role is, what you want it
11:09
to do, how it should behave, and you
11:11
should also just brain dump everything
11:12
about you and your business. So, I spent
11:14
like almost an hour just talking to
11:15
Claudebot, talking to Klouse, letting
11:17
him get to know me. I'm telling him, ask
11:18
me questions. What do you not know about
11:20
me? What do you need to know more about?
11:21
And this ends up creating a soul file.
11:23
So, the soul.md is basically who is your
11:26
AI and what's its job? And then also
11:28
creates a user.md file, which is
11:29
basically who am I and what do I do? So,
11:31
right here, I just asked Claus to
11:32
summarize the soul and user files. And
11:35
it came back with, "I'm Klouse, your
11:37
executive assistant. My job is to log
11:38
everything, track all my work,
11:40
communicate casual but concise, be
11:42
resourceful, and the user summary is
11:43
that you are Nate based in Chicago. Your
11:45
background is nontechnical, graduated
11:47
May 24, blah blah blah." So, it knows
11:49
all of this kind of stuff about my
11:50
business, about the platform, even know
11:52
some people on my team and stuff like
11:54
that. So, here's where I talk about
11:55
having the getting to know you
11:56
conversation, of course, covering
11:58
everything that you want it to know
11:59
about your business. And then, like I
12:00
said, prompt the AI to ask you questions
12:02
and be proactive about it. and the AI
12:04
will basically interview you which makes
12:06
everything better. So step two is to
12:08
create dedicated accounts for your AI.
12:10
So I don't think that you should be
12:11
giving Klouse or whatever you call it
12:13
access to your accounts directly. I
12:15
didn't want Claus to be logged in as you
12:17
know my main email or my main calendar
12:19
or my main ClickUp cuz you just don't
12:21
really know what could happen. So
12:22
instead if I give it an email account
12:24
and I wanted to help me manage my email,
12:26
well I can just forward at things and I
12:27
can CC him on things and that way he's
12:30
kind of looped in as I would treat an
12:31
actual like executive assistant. The way
12:33
that I think about it is if you had like
12:35
a VA or someone that you brought onto
12:37
the team and you wanted to take on a lot
12:38
of administrative roles, would you give
12:40
them right away like credit card
12:41
information, bank account information,
12:43
passwords, access to everything? I I
12:45
probably wouldn't. And on top of that,
12:47
Claus has its own Drive, Docs, Calendar,
12:50
so that it can see my calendar and it
12:52
can, you know, share files with me and
12:54
request access, but it's not actually
12:56
going to be deleting things from my
12:57
environment just in case. Same thing for
12:59
task management. It's got a ClickUp
13:00
account. It can view my list. It can see
13:02
what's going on in the business, but
13:03
it's not able to really delete things
13:05
and change anything unless I give it
13:06
specific access to do so. And I put it
13:08
in its own environment with its own list
13:11
that I manage my tasks on now that it
13:13
can actually like change things and move
13:14
them around just to see how it's going
13:16
to work. And then of course, when it
13:17
comes to credentials, you want to be
13:19
storing this in av file. You don't want
13:21
to give it straight to Klaus in a
13:24
conversation history in Telegram in the,
13:27
you know, hub. So you can say, "Hey
13:28
Claus, I don't want you to ever mention
13:30
an API key in our conversation. I just
13:32
want you to use placeholders and just
13:34
help me get into myv file and I can drop
13:36
them in there." So you can either do
13:38
that through your terminal or you can
13:39
just open up in your file explorer and
13:41
go to thev file and add in all of your
13:44
API keys. So then of course on top of
13:46
this I just gave it read access to
13:47
pretty much everything. All the APIs
13:49
that it needs to use for you know
13:50
analytics or appy and things like that.
13:52
I gave it pretty much read access unless
13:54
it needs to do something. And if it
13:56
needs to do something, I would set up
13:57
like a spending limit or I would just
13:59
basically make sure that there's very
14:00
strict permissions. So it can look at my
14:02
calendar. I can forward it emails. It
14:04
has visibility into my tasks. And it has
14:06
access to certain things that I have as
14:08
far as like socials, but it can only
14:10
read and extract information. So it
14:12
can't post on my Twitter or reply to
14:14
things on YouTube or Twitter, but it can
14:16
grab a bunch of data, which is super
14:17
helpful. So phase four is about
14:19
developing the proactive mindset. This
14:21
is where it gets really, really powerful
14:22
and where it starts to feel different
14:23
than just like a cloud code or, you
14:26
know, an NN AI agent. So, I'm
14:28
consistently telling it, you know, I'm
14:29
running a lean business. I want to save
14:31
time. I want you to figure out
14:33
opportunities to be proactive and make
14:35
my life as easy as possible. Only loop
14:37
me in when you really need something
14:38
from me. So, you can say something like,
14:40
"Based on everything you know about me,
14:41
my business, and my goals, what are all
14:43
the ways that you could proactively help
14:44
me? Don't wait for me to ask, but what
14:46
would you do if your job was to save me
14:48
time every single day?" And after that,
14:50
it just started brainstorming and it
14:51
suggested a ton of ideas. So, at the
14:54
moment, the proactive things that I have
14:55
it doing are this. I've got a morning AI
14:57
news briefing. And it's not just
14:59
general, it's also like super specific
15:00
to me. I've got ClickUp task summaries
15:02
every day. So, every morning it looks at
15:04
my ClickUp and it says, "Hey, here's
15:05
what you've got today." And also, it
15:07
will try to give me things proactively
15:09
if it can help with any of those. So,
15:10
sometimes it'll do extra research for
15:12
me. If it's like a content flow or if
15:14
I've got a really busy day, it can maybe
15:15
suggest moving some of my, you know,
15:17
events on my calendar, things like that.
15:18
It does email monitoring every single 10
15:20
minutes. So, in its inbox, if I ever
15:22
send it something, it should respond
15:23
within 10 minutes or it should, you
15:25
know, kick off research or do something
15:26
else about it in 10 minutes. And with
15:28
the dashboard notes, it's supposed to
15:29
check this every 5 minutes, but we just
15:31
saw an example where it thought it was
15:32
every 30. So, there is a bit of a back
15:34
and forth. I will say the persistent
15:36
memory is cool, but it's not perfect at
15:38
all because it chooses what memories to
15:40
store and then sometimes it just forgets
15:42
things. And I'm going to talk about this
15:43
later. You can see that I've got a
15:44
memory system explainer doc that I had
15:46
to create. But the memory can sometimes
15:47
be a little frustrating. But honestly,
15:49
that's to be expected. So, you just have
15:50
to figure out, okay, how can I be
15:52
smarter than this thing and prompt it
15:54
and use it in the right way because yes,
15:55
it's really smart, but you have to use
15:57
it the right way because it can also be
15:58
super super dumb. I will admit last
16:00
night I got pretty frustrated at it and
16:02
I started calling it dumb and these
16:03
other names because I was just like I
16:05
had had it. Anyways, weekly it does
16:07
these things as we already talked about
16:08
and now we have the save me time
16:10
framework. So ask your AI, "What
16:12
currently takes me 20 plus minutes that
16:14
you could turn into a two-minute
16:15
review?" And asking it questions like
16:17
that really helps you spot these
16:19
opportunities. So when you actually want
16:20
to set up those automated workflows,
16:22
it's so so simple. You just ask it to do
16:24
something. So once it started analyzing
16:26
my YouTube and Twitter, I said, "Oh,
16:27
that's actually really cool. Can you
16:28
just set this up so that every morning
16:30
at 7:00 a.m. you do that?" And of
16:32
course, I could come back right here to
16:34
the actual log and see right here, 7
16:35
a.m. daily pulse has been delivered. And
16:37
then if I go up to 8 a.m. we have the
16:39
heartbeat dashboard notes none Gmail
16:41
none clickup summary sent to telegram.
16:43
So this just shows that it is working on
16:45
a cron and all you had to do was ask it
16:47
in natural language. So it's super cool.
16:49
Anyways then we got to the point where I
16:50
was like okay I want to build a
16:52
dashboard and I know that a lot of you
16:53
guys in the last video I showed the
16:55
dashboard asked about how I built it and
16:57
really it's just a matter of going back
16:58
and forth but there are some hacks that
17:00
I want to talk about that really make it
17:02
easier to actually be able to build the
17:03
dashboard out. So first of all you want
17:04
to have a really clear goal of what
17:06
you're actually building. So my
17:07
components are a status panel. So I can
17:09
see if the AI is working idle or
17:11
offline. I can see if there's sub aents
17:13
and I can see what task it's currently
17:14
working on. Of course, we've got the
17:16
actual cambban board. So the to-do, the
17:18
in progress, the done. The AI will
17:20
update it as it works. The activity log
17:22
is like a non-negotiable. You have to
17:24
see every single time you do any action,
17:26
you have to log it. That's just the
17:28
ability for us to come here, drop in a
17:30
note, and then have it be able to store
17:31
that as memory. And honestly, this was
17:33
more so for me testing if it would
17:35
actually work. Because realistically, if
17:36
I wanted to drop in a note, I would
17:38
probably rather just come to Telegram
17:39
and shoot off a message. But the tough
17:41
part can be actually getting it to
17:42
remember to do things specifically like
17:44
updating the Camban board or logging
17:46
things. And so what I realize here is it
17:48
has to do with the memory. And a lot of
17:50
times it won't actually store things as
17:51
long-term memory or daily memory. So to
17:54
contextualize this a little bit, let me
Memory Explained
17:55
go to the memory system explainer doc.
17:57
So this basically explains how
17:59
Cloudbot's memory works because it's not
18:00
super intuitive. We obviously have the
18:02
soul file, the user file, the identity
18:04
file. So, it's got these that it is able
18:05
to check in on, but then what it starts
18:07
to do is it creates these different
18:08
logs. So, it creates a daily log, which
18:11
are raw notes from each day. And that's
18:13
basically like what happened, decisions
18:14
made, context. It's a journal. But
18:17
again, the tough part is Claus chooses
18:20
what to put in the daily log journal.
18:22
And so, even sometimes I'm like, hey,
18:23
log that because you have to remember
18:25
it. Sometimes it won't. The long-term
18:26
memory are more of like the curated
18:28
highlights about your facts, your
18:30
lessons learned, your business, things
18:31
like that. And then when you're working
18:33
on specific projects, it can create
18:35
project specific memories. And so it
18:37
really is a matter of prompting it like
18:38
make sure you save this to that project
18:40
memory or save this to your daily log.
18:42
And if you're not doing that, then
18:43
you're going to be really confused as
18:44
far as like where is it getting into
18:46
information and why is it confused.
18:48
Okay, I just searched our chat history
18:50
for the word frustrating because I knew
18:51
I've said it to Klaus many times. And so
18:53
this is exactly what I'm talking about.
18:55
I said, "This is a problem. I need to be
18:57
able to know that you have memory that's
18:58
persistent. So if we're having a
18:59
conversation, you can see what I'm
19:01
talking about because you just sent me a
19:02
message about 4 minutes ago and all of a
19:04
sudden you forgot that context. So what
19:06
can I do in your configuration so that
19:07
this doesn't happen again? It's really
19:08
frustrating. I need to be able to trust
19:10
that I can have an ongoing conversation
19:11
with you. And then I would basically
19:13
just have to repaste in messages so it
19:15
could reand context of what we were just
19:17
talking about. And I'm not even
19:19
exaggerating. It would be like I would
19:20
say hello and then I would say my name
19:22
is Nate and it would be like okay cool.
19:23
And then I'd say like how's how are you
19:26
doing? And it would be like what's your
19:26
name? It's like that quick. it would
19:28
forget what we were talking about. So
19:29
really the key thing to remember is that
19:31
it's always basically going to wake up
19:33
with no memory. So those files are the
19:35
memory. And so that's why I'm telling it
19:36
log everything you do. Check these files
19:39
every time. Put that in the right spot.
19:40
And so this is a really nice segue into
The 5 Hacks
19:42
the hacks that I wanted to talk about
19:43
because as I have been obviously playing
19:46
around with Cloudbot for days now, I've
19:49
learned a lot of things about the way
19:50
you can communicate with it to actually
19:51
make it do what you want to do. So the
19:53
first one right here is plan first. This
19:55
one is so important. If you've been
19:57
using cloud code for a while, you know
19:58
how important it is to use plan mode
20:00
first and then go ahead and execute. But
20:01
the tough part about planning first is
20:04
sometimes it'll make an amazing plan.
20:06
I'll spin up three sub agents. It'll
20:07
build me a beautiful plan and then I'll
20:09
say nice, execute that and it'll be like
20:11
execute what? And that just makes me
20:13
want to throw my monitor against the
20:14
wall. So what you could do there is you
20:16
could copy and paste the plan into the
20:18
next message and shoot it off. Or maybe
20:19
you could just say build a really good
20:21
plan and then execute. Cuz that still
20:23
increases the quality of the actual
20:25
solution itself. But another thing I
20:26
started doing which actually helped a
20:28
lot and I'm I'm going out of order a bit
20:30
here but I was just creating files all
20:31
the time. And so that's why I really
20:33
wanted to make this dashboard where I
20:34
could search through all my documents.
20:36
So if I go to like a you know PDF
20:38
generation I can search through and we
20:39
can see every doc that I've created and
20:41
I knew that this was going to be huge
20:43
because I ask it to create docs all the
20:45
time. Basically my hypothesis was if it
20:47
creates me this plan and then it creates
20:49
a document out of it. It can obviously
20:50
read those documents. So, I create a
20:52
plan doc and then I say, "Cool, execute
20:54
that plan doc." And then it's like it's
20:56
it's caught up on all the context right
20:57
there and I don't have to get so
20:58
frustrated. So, plan first and create
21:01
files for basically everything you're
21:02
doing. Just tell it to create a doc and
21:04
put it into your dashboard. So, the next
21:05
one is about proactivity. And so, we
21:07
already talked about this one a little
21:08
bit, but it's just the idea of thinking
21:10
about how can you make this thing
21:11
really, really awesome because if you
21:14
take away the proactivity, it's very,
21:16
very similar to a lot of the other AI
21:18
tools that you probably already use. So
21:19
proactivity not just meaning doing
21:21
things on a schedule because any
21:22
automation can check Twitter every 30
21:23
minutes and give you a breakdown.
21:25
Productivity in the way of like what do
21:27
you know about me and my business? Where
21:28
do you see what you're doing and where
21:30
I'm doing and figure out how you can
21:32
save me time and solve problems before I
21:33
even know that those problems exist? So
21:35
like reading through emails and reading
21:37
through ClickUp. And if you realize that
21:38
there might be an action item, just go
21:39
ahead and take that action. or when
21:41
you're running a SWAT analysis for me
21:42
and you have action items, why don't you
21:44
just take those action items, put them
21:45
in your own to-do list, and then start
21:47
like banging them out, which is
21:49
basically exactly how we were able to
21:50
actually have Claus work all night long
21:52
is I said, "Okay, let's brainstorm here.
21:54
Let's figure out what it would take to
21:56
build a YouTube dashboard and let's
21:58
basically make like six tasks to do
22:00
this." And they're chronological. And
22:02
what I want you to do is on your
22:03
heartbeat every 30 minutes or so, pick
22:05
up a task, contextualize. So read the
22:07
GitHub repository, read all of the past
22:09
stuff that's going on, and then build.
22:11
And then before you actually shut down
22:13
on that task, recommit it to GitHub and
22:15
re-update like all the information so
22:17
that next time you wake up with fresh
22:18
context and you pick up this task again,
22:20
you can actually understand where you
22:22
just left off. So that is the really
22:24
important part that takes a little bit
22:25
of more time to orchestrate. And like I
22:27
said, I got a little frustrated trying
22:28
to figure out how to do it. But it just
22:30
takes being logical and talking clearly.
22:34
Now, the next thing is discipline. So,
22:35
it's going to make a ton of mistakes.
22:37
Like, it just will. I've seen it make so
22:38
many more mistakes than I thought it
22:40
would. But the idea is when it makes a
22:42
mistake, that's an opportunity to learn,
22:44
both you and Klouse. So, when it makes a
22:47
mistake, I basically say, "hm, what I
22:49
want you to do is spin up some agents
22:50
and analyze and audit what you just did.
22:53
Why did that break? Why did it not work?
22:55
Analyze all the other options. And most
22:57
importantly, tell me which option will
22:59
make sure that this doesn't ever happen
23:00
again." And then turn all of that into a
23:02
doc and store that somewhere. And so
23:04
it's like how can I give it how can I
23:06
let it learn from its mistakes rather
23:08
than just saying you suck, you're doing
23:11
this bad, try again. And then the fifth
23:12
one was about memory. So all of these
23:15
hacks kind of, you know, flow into
23:16
memory. And we've talked about memory a
23:17
little bit, but that's like, like I
23:19
said, that's something that's really
23:20
frustrating. The reason I threw this on
23:22
here is because it's not just something
23:23
that's super intuitive. It just takes
23:25
actual time and repetition talking to
23:27
this thing and understanding how it
23:29
learns and how it sees things. So you'll
23:31
get better at understanding how to tweak
23:33
your prompts a little bit. so that it's
23:34
all in one go rather than multiple goes.
23:37
Because what's cool about Klouse is you
23:39
can shoot off like five messages in a
23:40
row and it will cue them. So it will go
23:42
ahead and do the first one and then it
23:43
will do the second one and it'll do the
23:44
third one. But it's doing each of them
23:45
individually. So if I schedule off like
23:48
three different things, it will do them
23:49
in order. So go ahead and tell me a
23:51
riddle. Find me a YouTube video today
23:54
about Claudebot that's performing really
23:56
well. Do some research on the difference
23:58
between pancakes and waffles. find me
24:00
some exp posts today about the end
24:02
vulnerability thing. But anyways, my
24:04
point being, if you wanted to send off
24:06
all of these three, but you wanted them
24:07
to be together, you have to put it in
24:09
the same box and the same message as you
24:11
send it off. So, it actually treats it
24:12
as one message. Now, I do have one final
24:14
bonus hack for you guys, which is cloud
24:16
code. If you get to a point where you're
24:18
confused and you just don't really
24:19
understand what you should be doing with
24:20
your maybe your configuration or your
24:22
keys or security, then definitely
24:24
utilize cloud code. And I will say I'm
24:26
not ashamed to admit that I did use
24:28
cloud code. So I set up a project called
24:31
Klouse and I basically gave cloud code
24:33
access to this project, right? And it
24:35
can see my backups, my configs, my docs,
24:37
my scripts, the cloud.mmd file, my
24:39
credentials and it understands how to
24:41
help me set up the environment. And
24:42
sometimes it actually helps to be able
24:44
to plan in here first and then take that
24:46
plan to Klouse because if you were going
24:48
to use like a claude or a perplexity to
24:50
help you set up this stuff anyways, you
24:52
might as well do it in a claude code
24:53
project that can actually help you
24:54
create files and navigate through a
24:56
project like this. It just felt like
24:57
there was way more context, especially
24:59
when I could give it a special system
25:00
prompt to help me with this project. So,
25:03
if you hit a roadblock, maybe just try
25:05
throwing some stuff into cloud code and
25:06
seeing what it can do. But anyways,
